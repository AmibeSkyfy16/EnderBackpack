# SingleBackpack

## Basic
This mod add a backpack, but only one backpack
Even if you duplicate the item, the content of the duplicated item will be identical to the first one.

As the player spends more time on the server, the backpack will grow.
The default configuration is as follows:

  0 hours / 1*9 slots   when the player has played 0 hours on the server

  2 hours / 2*9 slots   when the player has played 2 hours on the server
  
  3 hours / 3*9 slots   when the player has played 3 hours on the server
  
  24 hours / 5*9 slots  ...
  
  72 hours / 6*9 slots  ...
  
  

## There are two way to use this mod
Either the players receive a backpack, at their first connection, or they will have to craft it (default)
you can configure this in the file config.json under SingleBackpack folder


## Why this mod?

Today minecraft contains a lot more items than before, especially with 1.18 update and not to mention the mods that add a lot of items.
Players need more space in their inventory.
Most of the backpack mods can be crafted easily and have their own content, so there is no interest in shulkerboxes anymore.

this mod is the perfect compromise
