# SingleBackpack

## Basic
This mod add a backpack, but only one backpack (uncraftable)
Even if you duplicate the item, the content of the duplicated item will be identical to the first one.

## There are two to use this mod
Either the players receive a backpack, at their first connection, or they will have to craft it (default)
you can configure this in the file config.json under backpack folder


## Why this mod?

Today minecraft contains a lot more items than before, especially with 1.18 update and not to mention the mods that add a lot of items.
Players need more space in their inventory.
Most of the backpack mods can be crafted easily and have their own content, so there is no interest in shulkerboxes anymore.

this mod is the perfect compromise
