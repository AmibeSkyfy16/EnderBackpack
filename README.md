# SingleBackpack

## Basic

This mod add a backpack, but only one backpack (uncraftable)
Even if you duplicate the item, the content of the duplicated item will be identical to the first one.

The mod add a gamerule called GIVE_PLAYER_BACKPACK, true by default
When a player logs in, they will receive the backpack


## Why this mod?

Today minecraft contains a lot more items than before, especially with 1.18 and not to mention the mods that add a lot of items.
Players need more space in their inventory.
Most of the backpack mods can be crafted easily and have their own content, so there is no interest in shulkerboxes anymore.

this mod is the perfect compromise
