[//]: # (# Description)

[//]: # (This mod adds a backpack, but with unique content per player. Even if you duplicate it, its contents will be identical to the first one. A bit like an enderchest)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (As the player spends more time on the server, the backpack will grow and the player will be able to store more items. The default configuration is as follows:)

[//]: # (| hours  | slots available                       |)

[//]: # (| ------ |:----------------:| )

[//]: # (|    0   | 1*9 = 9          |)

[//]: # (|    1   | 2*9 = 18         |)

[//]: # (|    2   | 3*9 = 27         |)

[//]: # (|    4   | 4*9 = 36         |)

[//]: # (|   12   | 5*9 = 45         |)

[//]: # (|   36   | 6*9 = 54         |)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (You can create your own ***sizes*** by settings a time in millisecond as key and a number of rows as value)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (max rows is 6)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (**Important !**)

[//]: # (**Values in the list must be sorted from smallest to largest. whether it is the size or the delay**)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## There are two way to use this mod)

[//]: # (1. Players will receive a backpack when they log in &#40;only if they don't already have one&#41;<br />Here is the configuration of the **config.json** file to use the first way<br/>![Alt text]&#40;https://github.com/AmibeSkyfy16/EnderBackpack/blob/1.18.2/images/config_first_way.png&#41;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (2. Players will have to craft the backpack<br/>Here is the configuration of the **config.json** file to use the second way<br/>![Alt text]&#40;https://github.com/AmibeSkyfy16/EnderBackpack/blob/1.18.2/images/config_second_way.png?raw=true&#41;<br/>And this is the craft<br/>![Alt text]&#40;https://github.com/AmibeSkyfy16/EnderBackpack/blob/1.18.2/images/craft.png?raw=true&#41;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Other configurations)

[//]: # (You can choose if you want the contents of the backpack to be dropped to the ground when the players die using the settings option called dropBackpackContentWhenDying &#40;by default, the contents are saved &#40;as an enderchest&#41;. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Why this mod)

[//]: # (Today, Minecraft contains many more items than before, especially with the 1.18 update and not to mention the mods that add a lot of items. Players need more space in their inventory. Most of the backpack mods can be made easily and have their own inventory &#40;not a unique content per player&#41;, so there is no more interest in shulkerboxes.)
